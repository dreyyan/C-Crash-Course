====================================================================================================
What is Computer Science?
- study of computers and computational systems
- how computers work, how to program them, and how to solve problems 'efficiently'
====================================================================================================
Important Values in Computer Science:
- Problem-solving
- Logic
- Creativity
====================================================================================================
Programming Language
- a formal language used by humans to write instructions that a computer can understand and execute
====================================================================================================
Types of Programming Languages:
1. Low-level
- closer to hardware
- difficult to write
- higher control & performance
(e.g., Assembly, C)

2. High-level
- closer to human language
- easier to write
- developer-friendly
(e.g., Python, Java, JavaScript, C++)
====================================================================================================
Before learning a programming language, ask yourself:
1. "Which programming language should I learn?"
2. "Why am I learning _____? For fundamentals? Or for a real-world applications?"
====================================================================================================
Objective/s:
1. Learn C++ as a fundamental programming language
2. Understand the basics of programming
3. Develop a personal project of your choice (Go wild!)
====================================================================================================
Personal Advice:
1. ❌ Vibe Coding ❌
2. Don't just watch, DO.
3. Be creative!
====================================================================================================
PRE-REQUISITES
I.      Download a C++ Compiler (GCC)
II.     Setup your IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
III.    Write your first C++ Code (Hello World)
