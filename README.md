## 📘 What is Computer Science?

> The study of computers and computational systems.

It involves:
- Understanding how computers work
- Learning how to program them
- Solving problems *efficiently*

---

## 💡 Important Values in Computer Science

- 🔧 Problem-solving  
- 🧠 Logic  
- 🎨 Creativity

## 🖥️ What is a Programming Language?

A **programming language** is a formal way for humans to write instructions that a computer can understand and execute.

---

## 🧵 Types of Programming Languages

### 1. Low-Level Languages
- Closer to hardware
- Difficult to write
- High control and performance  
🛠️ *Examples: Assembly, C*

### 2. High-Level Languages
- Closer to human language
- Easier to write
- Developer-friendly  
🧪 *Examples: Python, Java, JavaScript, C++*

---

## 🤔 Before You Learn a Language...

Ask yourself:
1. "Which programming language should I learn?"
2. "Why am I learning C++? For fundamentals? Or for real-world applications?"

---

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Learn C++ as a fundamental programming language  
2. Understand the basics of programming  
3. Develop a personal project of your choice *(go wild!)*

---

## 🙋‍♂️ Personal Advice

- ❌ Don’t just *vibe code* — be intentional  
- ✅ Don’t just watch, **DO**
- 🎨 Be creative!
